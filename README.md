#Embedded C circular buffer (PIC18F14K22)

Welcome to the PIC18F14K22 implementation of a circular buffer! This code is optimized for use with the PICKit 3 starter kit. The handy starter board gives you an LED array and a switch to start with.

This project requires one momentary pushbutton external to the starter kit. This button should connect RA3 and GND,and connect RA3 to ground when the button is pushed.

*NB: Admittedly, I need to clean up this repo a bit to remove all the build files. Regardless, picbuffer.c is where the magic happens.
